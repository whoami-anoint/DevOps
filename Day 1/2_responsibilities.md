# Day 1 - Part 2: Introduction to DevOps
## Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer

- DevOps is the link between developers creating applications and the infrastructure that runs them.
- DevOps engineers don't program the application but need to understand developer concepts and tools.
- DevOps engineers configure how the application talks to its required services and handle deployment and server configuration.
- Servers running the application can be on-premises, public cloud, or serverless (less common).
- DevOps engineers need foundational knowledge of networking but don't need to be specialists in that area.
- The application might be developed to run as containers, so knowledge of virtualization, Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and containerization is important.
- DevOps engineers are responsible for continuously and efficiently releasing new application versions, including testing, in an automated manner.
- The goal is to make these processes seamless and automated to ensure the smooth delivery of new features and bug fixes to end users.
