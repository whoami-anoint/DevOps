## Day 13 | Top 15 AWS Services that Every DevOps Engineers should learn

DevOps engineers are responsible for automating and streamlining the software development and deployment process. To do this effectively, they need to have a strong understanding of AWS services.

Here are the top 15 AWS services that every DevOps engineer should learn:

1. **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is the most popular AWS service, and it is used to power a wide variety of applications, including web servers, databases, and application servers.
2. **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)**: S3 is an object storage service that provides secure, durable, and highly scalable object storage. It is used to store any amount of data, including files, images, videos, and backups.
3. **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)**: RDS is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports a variety of database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
4. **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: VPC is a web service that lets you create a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a private network. This allows you to control the flow of network traffic between your resources and the internet.
5. **Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: ELB distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, and containers. This helps to improve the availability and performance of your applications.
6. **Amazon CloudFormation**: CloudFormation is a web service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources. It lets you define your infrastructure in a template, which you can then use to create your resources in a consistent and repeatable way.
7. **AWS CodePipeline**: CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that helps you automate the build, test, and deployment of your code. It can be used to deploy your code to a variety of targets, including EC2 instances, Elastic Beanstalk, and CodeDeploy.
8. **AWS CodeDeploy**: CodeDeploy is a deployment service that helps you automate the deployment of code to EC2 instances. It can be used to deploy code using a variety of deployment methods, including blue/green deployments and rolling deployments.
9. **AWS CodeCommit**: CodeCommit is a managed Git repository service that helps you store, manage, and review code. It can be used to collaborate on code with other developers and to track changes to your code over time.
10. **AWS CloudWatch**: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that helps you monitor the performance and health of your AWS resources. It can be used to collect metrics, logs, and events from your resources, and to create alarms to notify you when there are problems.
11. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM is a security service that helps you control who has access to your AWS resources and what actions they can perform. It can be used to create users and groups, and to assign permissions to users and groups.
12. **AWS Systems Manager**: Systems Manager is a management service that helps you automate the management of your AWS resources. It can be used to deploy applications, manage patches, and configure AWS resources.
13. **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS Cloud.
14. **AWS CodeBuild**: CodeBuild is a build service that helps you build and test your code. It can be used to build code using a variety of build tools, including Maven, Gradle, and Docker.
15. **AWS CodeArtifact**: CodeArtifact is a package repository service that helps you manage and share software packages with your team. It can be used to store packages from a variety of sources, including Maven, npm, and PyPI.

These are just a few of the many AWS services that DevOps engineers should learn. By learning about these services, DevOps engineers can automate and streamline their work, and make their teams more productive.

**Bonus tip:** AWS offers a variety of certifications for DevOps engineers, including the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional certification. This certification is a great way to demonstrate your skills and knowledge of AWS services.
