### Agile Development:
- Focuses on delivering small results faster through iterative development.
- Releases new versions frequently with incremental updates.
- Aims to deliver an optimal experience to end-users.

### DevOps:
- Involves cooperation between software developers and operations specialists.
- Aims to simplify the development process and minimize miscommunication.
- Covers development, QA, and operations, and is involved in all stages of the product cycle.

### Difference between Agile and DevOps:
- Agile targets communication with end-users, while DevOps focuses on internal practices.
- Agile is outward-oriented, whereas DevOps is a set of internal practices.
- Agile mainly applies to software developers and project managers, while DevOps involves development, QA, and operations.

### Target Areas:
- Agile focuses more on software development, while DevOps covers deployment and post-release stages like monitoring, high availability, security, and data protection.

### Tools Used:
- Agile tools focus on management, communication, collaboration, metrics, and feedback processing.
- DevOps uses tools for team communication, software development, deployment, and integration.

### Combining Agile and DevOps:
- The combination brings flexible management and powerful technology.
- Agile practices improve communication within DevOps teams.
- The automation cost for DevOps is justified by the agile requirement of deploying quickly and frequently.
- The combination leads to better product quality and strengthened teamwork.

### Steps to Adopt Agile and DevOps Simultaneously:
1. Unite development and operation teams.
2. Create build and run teams for discussing development and operational concerns.
3. Change the approach to sprints and assign priority ratings for DevOps tasks.
4. Include QA in all development stages.
5. Choose the right tools.
6. Automate everything possible.
7. Measure and control using tangible numeric deliverables.
