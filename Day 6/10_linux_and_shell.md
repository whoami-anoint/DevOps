### Key Points

1. **Introduction to Linux Operating System**
   - Linux is a robust open-source operating system commonly used in server environments.
   - Key characteristics include security, stability, and a wide range of distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian).
   - Understanding Linux fundamentals is crucial for DevOps professionals as many cloud servers run on Linux distributions.

2. **Basic Linux Commands**
   - Learn essential Linux commands for effective command-line navigation and management.
   - Common commands include:
     - `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
     - `cd`: Change directories.
     - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
     - `mkdir`: Create directories.
     - `rm`: Remove files or directories.
     - `cp`: Copy files and directories.
     - `mv`: Move or rename files and directories.
     - `ps`: List running processes.
   - Practice these commands to become familiar with the Linux file system.

3. **Introduction to Shell Scripting**
   - Shell scripting involves writing and executing scripts in a shell (command-line environment) to automate tasks.
   - Common shells include Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Zsh, and Fish.
   - Shells interpret and execute commands, making them powerful tools for automation.

4. **Writing Your First Shell Script**
   - Start by creating a simple "Hello World" script in Bash or your preferred shell.
   - Open a text editor and write your script, e.g.:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Hello, DevOps!"
     ```
   - Make the script executable using the `chmod` command:
     ```bash
     chmod +x scriptname.sh
     ```
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     ./scriptname.sh
     ```

5. **Best Practices for Shell Scripting**
   - Use comments extensively to document your scripts for better readability.
   - Ensure your scripts have proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
   - Keep scripts modular and reusable by defining functions.
   - Follow security best practices to prevent unauthorized access to your scripts.
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords or API keys in your scripts.

### Homework
- Practice basic Linux commands by navigating through your system, creating, moving, and deleting files and directories.
- Write a simple shell script that performs a task of your choice and share it in the discussions for feedback.
