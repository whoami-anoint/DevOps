# Day 2 - Improve SDLC with DevOps

### Agenda
- Introduction to SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- Understanding the need for DevOps in SDLC
- Key benefits of integrating DevOps in SDLC
- DevOps principles and practices

### Key Takeaways
1. **SDLC Overview**
   - SDLC is a structured process for developing software, comprising phases like planning, designing, coding, testing, and deployment.
   - Traditional SDLC models are often slow and lack flexibility.

2. **Why DevOps in SDLC?**
   - DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations teams.
   - It aims to automate and streamline the software delivery process.
   - Faster development cycles, quicker releases, and reduced errors are some benefits.

3. **Benefits of DevOps Integration**
   - Improved collaboration between teams.
   - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) enable faster release cycles.
   - Enhanced quality through automated testing.
   - Efficient use of resources and reduced manual interventions.

4. **DevOps Principles**
   - Automation: Automate repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
   - Collaboration: Foster collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
   - Continuous Integration (CI): Frequent code integration to detect issues early.
   - Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate the deployment process to production.
   - Monitoring and Feedback: Monitor application performance and gather feedback for improvement.

### Homework
- Research and list down at least three real-world examples of companies that have successfully implemented DevOps in their SDLC. Be prepared to discuss these examples in tomorrow's class.
