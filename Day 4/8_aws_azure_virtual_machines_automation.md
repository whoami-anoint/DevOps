### Key Points

1. **Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS/Azure**
   - Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, and databases over the internet.
   - AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure (Microsoft Azure) are two major cloud service providers.

2. **Creating Virtual Machines on AWS and Azure**
   - AWS offers services like Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for creating and managing virtual machines.
   - Azure provides Azure Virtual Machines for VM creation and management.
   - Steps to create VMs on AWS and Azure will be discussed in the next class.

3. **AWS Scripting, AWS CLI, and AWS CloudFormation (CFT)**
   - AWS scripting involves using languages like Python or JavaScript to automate tasks in AWS.
   - AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to interact with AWS services through the command line.
   - AWS CloudFormation (CFT) is a service for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure as code.

4. **Automation in AWS and Azure**
   - Automation in the cloud involves scripting and using tools to automate provisioning, scaling, and management of resources.
   - AWS offers services like AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and AWS Systems Manager for automation.
   - Azure provides automation capabilities through Azure Automation and Azure Functions.

5. **Key Differences Between Azure and AWS**
   - Azure and AWS have differences in terms of services, pricing, and ecosystem.
   - It's important to consider factors like familiarity with tools and specific requirements when choosing between them.

### Homework
- Explore AWS CLI and run basic commands to interact with AWS resources. Share your experience in the next class.

### Additional Resources
- [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/)
- [AWS CloudFormation Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- [Azure Automation Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/)

Active participation in discussions and hands-on experience with AWS CLI and CloudFormation will help you gain practical skills in automation and cloud management.
