## Day-14 | Configuration Management with Ansible

**What is configuration management?**

Configuration management is the process of ensuring that all of your IT systems are configured in a consistent and desired state. This is important for a number of reasons, including security, compliance, and performance.

**What is Ansible?**

Ansible is a popular configuration management tool that can be used to manage a wide variety of systems, including servers, network devices, and cloud infrastructure. Ansible is easy to use and can be scaled to manage large numbers of systems.

**How Ansible works**

Ansible uses a simple but powerful language called YAML to define desired system configurations. Ansible then uses SSH to connect to the systems and apply the desired configurations.

Ansible is agentless, which means that it does not require any software to be installed on the systems being managed. This makes it easy to get started with Ansible and to manage systems that are not under your direct control.

**Benefits of using Ansible**

There are many benefits to using Ansible for configuration management, including:

* **Simplicity:** Ansible is easy to learn and use, even for beginners.
* **Scalability:** Ansible can be used to manage large numbers of systems with ease.
* **Agentless:** Ansible does not require any software to be installed on the systems being managed.
* **Powerful:** Ansible can be used to manage a wide variety of systems and to perform complex tasks.

**Puppet vs Ansible**

Both Ansible and Puppet are popular configuration management tools. However, there are some key differences between the two tools.

| Feature | Ansible | Puppet |
|---|---|---|
| **Agentless** | Yes | No |
| **Declarative language** | Yes | Yes |
| **Push vs pull** | Pull | Push |
| **Configuration language** | YAML | Puppet DSL |

**Agentless** means that Ansible does not require any software to be installed on the systems being managed. This makes it easy to get started with Ansible and to manage systems that are not under your direct control. Puppet, on the other hand, requires a software agent to be installed on the systems being managed.

**Declarative language** means that both Ansible and Puppet allow you to define the desired state of your systems. The tools then figure out how to get the systems into the desired state.

**Push vs pull** means that Ansible pulls the desired configurations from the Ansible controller. Puppet, on the other hand, pushes the desired configurations to the systems being managed.

**Configuration language** refers to the language that is used to define the desired state of your systems. Ansible uses YAML, while Puppet uses Puppet DSL. YAML is a simpler language than Puppet DSL, but it is also less powerful.

**Choosing between Ansible and Puppet**

The best configuration management tool for you will depend on your specific needs. If you are looking for an easy-to-use and agentless configuration management tool, then Ansible is a good choice. If you need a more powerful and feature-rich configuration management tool, then Puppet is a good choice.


Ansible is a powerful and easy-to-use configuration management tool, but it also has some disadvantages. Here are some of the most common disadvantages of Ansible:

* **Performance:** Ansible can be slower than other configuration management tools, such as Puppet or Chef. This is because Ansible uses SSH to connect to the systems being managed, and SSH can be slow on large networks.
* **Complexity:** Ansible can become complex for managing large and complex infrastructures. The Ansible inventory file can become difficult to manage, and Ansible playbooks can become difficult to read and maintain.
* **Lack of GUI:** Ansible does not have a graphical user interface (GUI). This can make it difficult to learn and use Ansible for some users.
* **Limited support for Windows:** Ansible's support for Windows is not as mature as its support for Linux. This can make it difficult to use Ansible to manage Windows systems.

Despite these disadvantages, Ansible is still a popular configuration management tool. It is easy to learn and use, and it is agentless, which means that it does not require any software to be installed on the systems being managed.

Here are some additional disadvantages of Ansible:

* **No notion of state:** Ansible does not have a notion of state, which means that it does not track the current state of the systems being managed. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot problems and to ensure that systems are in the desired state.
* **Limited enterprise support:** Ansible does not have the same level of enterprise support as other configuration management tools, such as Puppet or Chef. This can be a disadvantage for organizations that need a high level of support.


**Conclusion**

Overall, Ansible is a good choice for organizations that are looking for an easy-to-use and agentless configuration management tool. However, it is important to be aware of the disadvantages of Ansible before making a decision.
