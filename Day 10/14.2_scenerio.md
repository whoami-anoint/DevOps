# Scenario 2 : 
Letâ€™s say we have an application that has two main components: frontend and backend. Their respective repositories are hosted at GitHub under different organizations.
------------------
Let's use the GitFlow branching strategy to manage the development of an application with two main components: frontend and backend, each hosted in separate repositories on GitHub under different organizations. This example will demonstrate how to coordinate work between these components:

### Frontend Repository (GitHub Organization: `frontend-team`)

#### Step 1: Create a New Feature Branch for Frontend

1. A developer from the frontend team starts by creating a new branch for a feature in the frontend component. They name it `feature/user-interface` based on the `develop` branch.

   ```shell
   git checkout -b feature/user-interface develop
   ```

   **Explanation**: This allows the frontend developer to work on the user interface feature without affecting other components.

#### Step 2: Work on Frontend Feature

2. The frontend developer makes changes to the user interface and commits them to the `feature/user-interface` branch.

   ```shell
   git commit -m "Add new UI components"
   ```

   **Explanation**: All changes are isolated to the frontend feature branch.

#### Step 3: Merge Frontend Feature into Develop

3. After completing the frontend feature, the developer merges it into the `develop` branch in the frontend repository.

   ```shell
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff feature/user-interface
   ```

   **Explanation**: This integrates the frontend feature into the ongoing development.

### Backend Repository (GitHub Organization: `backend-team`)

#### Step 4: Create a New Feature Branch for Backend

4. A developer from the backend team creates a new branch for a feature in the backend component. They name it `feature/user-authentication` based on the `develop` branch.

   ```shell
   git checkout -b feature/user-authentication develop
   ```

   **Explanation**: This allows the backend developer to work on user authentication independently.

#### Step 5: Work on Backend Feature

5. The backend developer implements user authentication and commits changes to the `feature/user-authentication` branch.

   ```shell
   git commit -m "Implement user authentication"
   ```

   **Explanation**: Backend changes are isolated to the backend feature branch.

#### Step 6: Merge Backend Feature into Develop

6. Once the backend feature is complete, the developer merges it into the `develop` branch in the backend repository.

   ```shell
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication
   ```

   **Explanation**: This integrates the backend feature into the ongoing development.

### Coordinating Across Repositories

#### Step 7: Synchronize Changes Between Frontend and Backend

7. Now that both frontend and backend features are developed and integrated into their respective `develop` branches, the teams need to synchronize these changes.

   - The frontend team may need to update their code to interact with the new backend authentication feature.
   - The backend team may need to provide API documentation or endpoint information to the frontend team.

   **Explanation**: Effective communication and coordination between teams are crucial at this stage to ensure seamless integration between components.

#### Step 8: Release Preparation

8. Once all features are implemented and tested, both frontend and backend teams create release branches for their respective components:

   - Frontend: `release/1.0.0`
   - Backend: `release/1.0.0`

   These branches allow for final testing and preparation before deployment.

#### Step 9: Merge Releases and Deploy

9. The teams merge their release branches into their respective `master` branches and deploy the application.

   - Frontend: Merge `release/1.0.0` into `master` and deploy the frontend.
   - Backend: Merge `release/1.0.0` into `master` and deploy the backend.

#### Step 10: Hotfix Handling

10. If any critical issues arise in production, hotfix branches can be created, fixed, and merged into both `master` and `develop` branches in their respective repositories.

This example demonstrates how GitFlow can be adapted to coordinate work between separate repositories for frontend and backend components, ensuring smooth development, integration, and release processes while maintaining isolation between teams. Effective communication and coordination between teams are key to success in this setup.
