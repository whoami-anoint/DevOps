### Plan:
- Planning phase where development team discusses features and bug fixes for the next sprint.
- DevOps engineer can influence decisions and work with the team on infrastructure considerations.

### Code:
- Development team writes the code, and DevOps engineer can help with infrastructure understanding.

### Build:
- Automation process kicks off to build the code, transpile, compile, or create a docker image using CI/CD pipeline.

### Testing:
- Development team writes tests, and tests are run to minimize introducing bugs and ensure the code works.

### Release:
- Code is prepared for release, may involve putting it in a registry or repository accessible to production servers.

### Deploy:
- Code is deployed into production, bringing the value of the hard work to the business.

### Operate:
- Post-deployment, monitoring and operational tasks come into play, like auto-scaling and feedback loop.

### Monitor:
- Monitoring is essential for operational issues, troubleshooting, and alerting about potential problems.

## Rinse & Repeat:
- The continuous loop of the DevOps lifecycle, going back to planning after each cycle.

## Continuous Delivery:
- Plan > Code > Build > Test, achieving a continuous process.

## Continuous Integration:
- Plan > Code > Build > Test > Release, outcome of Continuous Delivery and Release phases.

## Continuous Deployment:
- Successful release from Continuous Integration leads to Continuous Deployment:
  Deploy > Operate > Monitor.

## CI/CD:
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment, fundamental concepts in DevOps.

#### The DevOps lifecycle involves iterative phases from planning to continuous monitoring, fostering collaboration between development, QA, and operations teams to deliver high-quality, reliable software efficiently.
